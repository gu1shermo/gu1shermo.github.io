  abstract = {Algorithmic composition is the technique of using algorithms to create music. Algorithms (or, at the very least, formal sets of rules) have been used to compose music for centuries; the procedures used to plot voice-leading in Western counterpoint, for example, can often be reduced to algorithmic determinacy. The term can be used to describe music-generating techniques that run without ongoing human intervention, for example through the introduction of chance procedures. However through live coding and other interactive interfaces, a fully human-centric approach to algorithmic composition is possible.Some algorithms or data that have no immediate musical relevance are used by composers as creative inspiration for their music. Algorithms such as fractals, L-systems, statistical models, and even arbitrary data (e.g. census figures, GIS coordinates, or magnetic field measurements) have been used as source materials.},

Ce document partage quelques r{\'e}flexions {\'e}pist{\'e}mologiques sur ce domaine par nature interdisciplinaire (parties 1 {\`a} 3) et propose des r{\'e}sultats pr{\'e}liminaires d'une cartographie de ces recherches en France (parties 4 et 5). 1. AUX SOURCES DE L'INFORMATIQUE MUSICALE La science et la musique ont toujours eu des liens forts, tout d'abord sur des aspects de gammes et d'acoustique. Le Quadrivium fut d{\'e}fini par Bo{\`e}ce au VI e si{\`e}cle et re-groupe les arts lib{\'e}raux des << sciences des nombres >>, {\`a} savoir l'arithm{\'e}tique, la musique, la g{\'e}om{\'e}trie et l'astro-nomie. L'harmonie des sph{\`e}res, liant proportions c{\'e}lestes et musique, est une des th{\'e}ories pythagoriciennes {\'e}tudi{\'e}es par Bo{\`e}ce [4]. Mille ans plus tard, notamment {\`a} partir des ouvrages de Zarlino [27], les questions de temp{\'e}rament, c'est-{\`a}-dire de distribution fr{\'e}quentielle de la gamme, sont un sujet majeur de d{\'e}bat musical et scientifique du XVI e au XIX e si{\`e}cle. {\`A} c{\^o}t{\'e} des pr{\'e}occupations acoustiques, le c{\^o}t{\'e} plus sym-bolique et calculatoire de la musique a aussi une longue histoire, notamment pour la g{\'e}n{\'e}ration musicale [1]. Cer-tains W{\"u}rfelspiele du XVIII e si{\`e}cle, jeux musicaux al{\'e}a-toires, sont par exemple attribu{\'e}s {\`a} Mozart. L'{\'e}mergence de la pens{\'e}e informatique va de pair avec des r{\'e}flexions sur la musique algorithmis{\'e}e. En 1843, Ada Lovelace, per-cevant l'universalit{\'e} de la machine propos{\'e}e par Charles Babbage, imagine d{\'e}j{\`a} que la musique puisse se formali-ser au point que l'ordinateur devienne compositeur [11] : It might act upon other things besides number , were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine... Supposing, for instance , that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent. La pens{\'e}e s{\'e}rielle du d{\'e}but du XX e si{\`e}cle a aussi des aspects syst{\'e}matiques, parfois algorithmiques. Un si{\`e}cle apr{\`e}s Babbage et Lovelace, dans les ann{\'e}es 1940, les premiers ordinateurs suscitent rapidement des questions mu-sicales. D{\`e}s la fin des ann{\'e}es 1940, Alan Turing d{\'e}crit lui-m{\^e}me comment utiliser le haut-parleur du Mark II [6] :},

  abstract = {In this tool-assisted education video, I demonstrate how to write a program that creates a MIDI file from scratch. Some basics on how to write music in a computer program are shown. You see me type every line.  Twitter: ~~/~realbisqwit~~ Patreon: ~~/~bisqwit~~ (alternatives at https://iki.fi/bisqwit/donate.html) Twitch: ~~/~realbisqwit~~ Homepage: https://iki.fi/bisqwit/ MIDI is described in detail in Wikipedia, but put very shortly (and not entirely accurately), its best analogy is in sheet music rather than in an mp3 file. To play MIDI files, you need a synthesizer. There are computer synthesizer programs for various operating systems. In this video, I used an AdLib synthesizer for DOS that I wrote once -- apologies about that -- because I still could not figure out how to record audio from Linux synced to DOSBox's speed, or how to hook TiMidity++ into DOSBox, and DOSBox does not yet even emulate MPU-401 to begin with. The loopBegin and loopEnd tags are only supported by two MIDI players that I know: FMDRV, which I have created (seen in this video), and Final Fantasy VII by Square Enix. I hold it in a standard's esteem. Also, as a peculiar quirk, I happen to be running Linux under DOS in this video. I wrote a Linux emulator for DOS using Borland C++ ;-) Actually, what I wrote is just a (very fast and accurate) terminal emulator; the "simulated" Linux is actually the host computer under which the DOSBox instance runs. The MHz/GHz rating at the bottom of the screen is the speed by which the CPU emulated by DOSBox runs. I adjust it occasionally during the recording (to make it possible for me to type a long piece of text in a very short time), and the rating is updated in real time. Also, it is only faintly seen, but I launch a FreeDOS shell at one point. It is why you see two different kind of "DIR" responses in the video. My editor of choice is neither Vi nor Emacs, but Joseph Allen's Joe. Normally I use 256-color xterm, but here I am running under 16-color DOS and VGA text mode, so the 256-colorness is only emulated by dynamically remapping the palette on demand. As another peculiar quirk, my Linux "emulator" sets up a 51-line text mode by adding one extra line of text to the screen. Incidentally, I discovered, this mode has a screen resolution of 720x408, which makes it very close to the aspect ratio of 16:9 with square pixels. Hence I set the video aspect ratio to 16:9 rather than VGA's actual ratio, 4:3. This is the first programming example for which I did not print a script beforehand. I planned and created this entirely in one evening. Therefore there is no PDF to download. But you can download the MIDI file produced by the program, here: https://bisqwit.iki.fi/jutut/kuvat/pr... (it is my original composition). The source code that I typed in this video can be downloaded here: https://bisqwit.iki.fi/jutut/kuvat/pr... You can find the DOSBox Linux terminal hack here: -- https://bisqwit.iki.fi/src/patch-dosb... -- This patch must be applied into DOSBox. -- https://bisqwit.iki.fi/src/linux\_for\_... -- This is the terminal program that is run in DOSBox. Note that it uses hard-coded Finnish keyboard layout. It requires that DOSBox is patched using the above patch.}

This culture revolved around the production, dissemination, and competition of realtime generated audiovisual works (demos), demonstrating how to maximize specific hardware through unorthodox programming. The old demoscene was a closed community with its own infrastructure, artifacts, software tools, copyright system, aesthetics, economy, and social stratification, but new questions arise with its presence on the internet. With modems and illegal tricks to use telecommunications, teenagers at remote places could reach fame with their technical efforts in a subculture fenced off from real life identities. They were programmers, composers, and visual artists but also dedicated people that formed the backbone of the social network. Traders and swappers sent data around the world using modems or postal mail, sysops operated the bulletin board systems that people dialled with modems, while ascii artists designed the text-graphics for these boards. The demoscene receives very little attention in media, academia, and the arts. The paper will focus on communication but also explain the aesthetical aspects in order to fuel current discussions about open source creativity, remix culture, hacker art, digital communicative autonomy, and competition.},

This article shall focus in particular on the case of minimal run-time human intervention, where a program allows the creation of a musical variation, typically unravelling in realtime, on demand. These systems have the capacity to vary their output with each run, often from no more input information than the seeding of a random number generator with the start time. Such artworks are accumulating, released online as downloads, or exhibited through streaming radio sites such as rand()\%. Listener/users and composer/designers may wish for deeper insight into these programs' ontological status, mechanisms and creative potential. These works are challenging to dissect; this article makes a tentative start at confronting the unique problems and rich behaviours of computer-program-based generative music, from the social and historical context to the backwards engineering of programs in relation to their sound world. After a discussion of exemplars and definitions of generative art, strategies for analysis are outlined. To provide practical examples, analyses are provided of two small scale works by James McCartney.},

Often this activity takes place within some established language for computer music like SuperCollider, but there is no reason to stop errant minds pursuing their innovations in general scripting languages like Perl. This paper presents an introduction to the field of live coding, of real-time scripting during laptop music performance, and the improvisatory power and risks involved. We look at two test cases, the command-line music of slub utilising, amongst a grab-bag of technologies, Perl and REALbasic, and Julian Rohrhuber's Just In Time library for SuperCollider.

The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions (graphics, music, videos, games) are shared at festivals known as demoparties, voted on by those who attend and released online. The scene started with the home computer revolution of the early 1980s, and the subsequent advent of software cracking. Crackers altered the code of computer games to remove copy protection, claiming credit by adding introduction screens of their own ("cracktros"). They soon started competing for the best visual presentation of these additions. Through the making of intros and stand-alone demos, a new community eventually evolved, independent of the gaming:{$\mkern1mu$}29--30{$\mkern1mu$} and software sharing scenes. Demos are informally classified into several categories, mainly of size-restricted intros. The most typical competition categories for intros are the 64k intro and the 4K intro, where the size of the executable file is restricted to 65536 and 4096 bytes, respectively. In other competitions the choice of platform is restricted; only 8-bit computers like the Atari 800 or Commodore 64, or the 16-bit Amiga or Atari ST. Such restrictions provide a challenge for coders, musicians, and graphics artists, to make a device do more than was intended in its original design.},

A minima, le live-coding peut {\^e}tre caract{\'e}ris{\'e} par le fait que les algorithmes au centre de la performance soient {\'e}crits et manipul{\'e}s en temps r{\'e}el, les musiciens relevant le << d{\'e}fi >> d'entretenir une << inter- relation homme-machine >> le plus souvent improvis{\'e}e. Le couple {\'e}diteur-clavier constitue l'interface de communication premi{\`e}re et fondamentale du musicien {\`a} son instrument et du musicien {\`a} son public. Aujourd'hui en essor, cette pratique peut {\^e}tre per{\c c}ue comme une expression du d{\'e}sir de retrouver une plus grande proximit{\'e} et connexion au m{\'e}dium informatique ou comme une volont{\'e} d'explorer une approche interactive, computationnelle et algorithmique de la cr{\'e}ation musicale [6]. La pratique du live-coding trouve au travers des Algoraves 1 , {\'e}v{\`e}nements centr{\'e}s autour de la cr{\'e}ation algorithmique de musique de danse, sa manifestation la plus visible. Cet article souhaite {\'e}tudier la dimension proprement textuelle du live-coding ainsi que la relation du musicien {\`a} son support : le code source ou fichier de texte brut. Nous introduirons un n{\'e}ologisme, celui de musique de plain- texte. Nous jugeons ce terme pertinent pour comprendre la dimension esth{\'e}tique et politique qui sous-tend cette pratique. Nous essaierons {\'e}galement d'{\'e}valuer ce que ce terme peut apporter {\`a} une r{\'e}flexion sur la conception d'outils logiciels d{\'e}di{\'e}s au live-coding.},

  abstract = {Raymarching is a technique for rendering implicit surfaces using signed distance fields. It has been known and used since the 1980s for rendering fractals and CSG (constructive solid geometry) surfaces, but has rarely been used for commercial rendering applications such as film and 3D games. Raymarching was first used for photorealistic rendering in the mid 2000s by demoscene developers and hobbyist graphics programmers, receiving little to no attention from the academic community and professional graphics engineers. In the present work, we explain why the use of Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) by nearly all existing approaches leads to a number of inefficiencies, and hence set out to develop a CUDA oriented approach instead. We next show that the usual data handling pipeline leads to further unnecessary data flow overheads and therefore propose a novel pipeline structure that eliminates much of redundancy in the manner in which data are processed and passed. We proceed to introduce a series of data structures which were designed with the specific aim of exploiting the pipeline's strengths in terms of efficiency while achieving a high degree of photorealism, as well as the accompanying models and optimizations that ultimately result in an engine which is capable of photorealistic and real-time rendering on complex scenes and arbitrary objects. Lastly, the effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated in a series of experiments which compare our engine both in terms of visual fidelity and computational efficiency with the leading commercial and open source solutions, namely Unreal Engine and Blender.},

Computer technology, mostly due to the appearance of affordable Commodore 64's, entered households worldwide, providing the opportunity for everyone to create digital art. But existing art forms weren't the only ones to be re-implemented on these computers; brand new forms of art also appeared, ones thought to be impossible up to that point. Computers provided an opportunity for the creator to produce visuals and sound effects and combine them to create the ultimate audiovisual experience, by using only the language of mathematics and writing program code, without physical interaction. As a result of such techniques, demos were born, and with them, the demoscene subculture. A demo can best be understood as a spectacular animated music video which is usually a few minutes long. And yet it's something entirely different from a traditional video. Computer technics is the fastest developing part of our world, which produces more and more new opportunities for art. Moleman shows you now a digital subculture, where artists don't use always the latest technology, but their aim is also to bring out the best from 30 year-old computer technics.}

The book is centred around extensive descriptions of the most important works and compositional techniques, including in-depth explanations of the role of chance and indeterminacy in Cage's music. Dr Pritchett also considers the relationship of Cage's musical thought to his interests in such diverse subjects as Eastern philosophy and religion, Marshall McLuhan, and anarchism (among many others). This book thus makes the essential introduction to Cage's musical world.},

  abstract = {In this talk, I will introduce the topic of live coding -- the interactive programming experience for generating sound and visuals but this talk will mainly focus on the audio side. Live coders use programming languages to describe rules for generating music but then re-write these rules while the program is running. By continually writing and re-writing these rules live coders creating a shifting musical experience that is always in flux. All of this happens live in front of an audience with the code projected for all to see. I will go on to discuss a few of the many tools that are available for live coding and showcase the FoxDot environment, which allows you to live code music using Python. I will talk about the motivation for developing FoxDot and describe some of its key features as well as how you can set it up yourself at home. The talk will be concluded with a short demonstration that will be a partial explanation and partial performance.}

This group, the "demoscene," primarily consists of students who pursue their technical and artistic interests beyond the classroom, to create inspiring works of real-time art. These productions encompass a broad range of computer graphics techniques such as procedural geometry, real-time ray-tracing, and real-time shading. Game developers have been utilizing this talent pool yet it has little visibility in the SIGGRAPH community. This panel explores the demoscene, technical tricks used in demos, and how scene educational and creative aspects can contribute to the SIGGRAPH community.},

  abstract = {One of the goals of computing education research is to document the potential strengths and weaknesses of contemporary teaching methods in computing. Live coding has recently gained attention as one of the best practices for teaching programming. To offer a more comprehensive understanding of the existing body of research about live coding, we reviewed papers in computing education research that investigated the value of live coding in an educational setting. We categorized each paper based on (1) how it defines live coding, (2) whether its version of live coding could be considered active learning, (3) the type of study conducted, (4) types of data collected and the data analysis methods used, (5) evidence provided for the effectiveness of live coding, (6) reported benefits and drawbacks of live coding, and (7) reported theoretical frameworks used to explain the basis, effects or goals of live coding. We found that although live coding has been recommended as one of the best practices for teaching programming, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support claims about the effectiveness of live coding on student learning. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and suggest future research directions that could develop a more holistic understanding of this pedagogical technique.},

Liveness is one form of a more general class of behaviors by a programming environment that provide information to programmers about what they are constructing. This paper gives a brief historical perspective on liveness and proposes an extension of a hierarchy given in 1990, to now account for even more powerful executionoriented tools for programmers. In addition, while liveness concerns the timeliness of execution feedback, considering a broader array of forms of feedback is helpful both in better understanding liveness and in designing ever more powerful development tools.},
