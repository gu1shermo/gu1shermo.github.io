  abstract = {Live Coding is an electronic musical movement that is growing in popularity as an interface for musical expression where laptop performers program in front audiences; executing, editing, and re-executing blocks of code to generate music. The languages used in Live Coding are usually designed specifically for the purpose of creating music and distance themselves from the traditional paradigms of more general-purpose languages such as Java or Python. FoxDot is an application that bridges this gap to bring the art of performance programming and the science of software engineering together to create music in a way that is accessible to coders or composers; novices and experts alike.},
